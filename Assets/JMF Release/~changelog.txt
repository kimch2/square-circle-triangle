Changelog
##############

v1.4.0
-------------------------

* Fixed Unity2D "GameOverMsg" prefab. Was broken before this.

* Fixed PortalA / PortalB 'isFilled' now returns false.

* Collect Types game now ignores types beyond current GameManager active types.

* SpecialSix piece now set to deny swap with non-destructible piece to avoid visual bug.

* Improved eliminate pre-start match after manual assign.
     little/No more worries concerning pre-start match even on manual board color setup.

* Minor Bugfix on pre-start match engine.

* Bugfix Board reset script ignoring special piece swap. ( by default affected treasure piece only )

* added a new link for common usage codes reference - http://goo.gl/quVcTH




v1.3.3
-------------------------

* Added a Unity2D version of JMFP. Does not rely on 2D toolkit to operate.
  However, it is not mobile optimized. (many drawcalls)

* GameManager gravity check extremely minor changes.
    -> changed "countUnfilled()" to "countBlockedUnfilled()".

* PortalA script minor bugfix. ( could not teleport if PortalB is in 'x = 0' column )

* BoardLayout quick select option.
    -> has the ability to change mode between "click-for-next" & "quick-select" via holding the 'ctrl' button.



v1.3.2 (r2)
-------------------------

* Manual Update log from v1.3.1 to 1.3.2 made available for users whom has changed the default scripts

* Fixed Gravity after effects bug whereby z-order does not retain after tweening.

* More robust DestroyInTimeMarked() function.
   - previously will error when too many calls (crazy amount) are made in a very short period.

* More robust SuggestPiece() function.
   - previously will error when too many calls of 'notifyBoardHasChanged()' are made in a very short period.

* Fixed empty panel function reliance 'countBlockedUnfilled()'
   - was working.. but working via incorrect logic. Logic is now fixed.

* Update Board script's DestroyBox() function
   - previously, non-destructible gamePiece will not allow panelHit() on the boardbox.
     Now, Panel will get hit regardless of whether the gamePiece is destructible or not.

* Fixed mislabelled function 'isFillable()' for panelDefinition.
   - It actually determines whether the panel allows reset; nothing to do with gravity as suggested before.

* Super upgraded the BoardLayout script! more features and neater design!
   - switched the pieces to display textures too!
   - has a new option to use the board chooser for pieces and panels
   - slightly modified GUI layout for visual appeal.

* Transfered "justCreated" bool from Board class to GamePiece class to make it more stable.


v1.3.1
-------------------------

* Fixed Special piece being suggested even if it's there is not merge conditions.
    i.e., currently affected the treasure Piece only since it's the only special piece
          that has no merge conditions, thus bug went un-noticed.

* Fixed BoardLayout script crashing if you remove a panel/piece script from the middle of the list.

* Fixed "created by match" option of custom pieces working incorrectly.

* Fixed BoardPanel nullReferenceException when using users call SetType() during runtime.
    **will error if there is no piece on the board box + 'Has no starting piece' set 

* Added auto-call for 'notifyBoardHasChanged()' when users call setType() during runtime.

* Fixed "Special Piece" cannot merge with Normal Pieces because the call was initially rejected by GameManager.

* Added Treasure Piece Skin loop around for treasure pieces more than skin defined.
